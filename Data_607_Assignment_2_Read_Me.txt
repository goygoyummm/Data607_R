Hi Professor,

I made a survey in redcap and distributed it to 5 co-workers.
The instance of redcap is behind a firewall so I could not directly connect to to SQLite.
I exported the Movie Survey, 'MovieSurvey_DATA_LABELS_2023-02-03_1755', as a CSV file and then imported into SQLite.
In SQLite I converted the 'did not see' field to NULL values, see file 'Data_607_Assignment_2.sql'.
Then in I brought the DB,'Data_607_Assignment_2.DB' into R studio.
In R I deleted two columns that contained no data and knit the final table to PDF, see'Data_607_Assignment_2.pdf' and 'Data_607_Assignment_2.rmd'.
Please let me know if I am missing something.
Have a great day!

Gregg
